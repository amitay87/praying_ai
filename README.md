# Praying AI
research project that intended to cautiously examine the issue of a praying artificial intelligence

# Background - The problem
The AI world is fascinating. it has great power. it allows us to do let the machines learn the rules by themselves. this can be fantastic and lead to prosperity of the human kind. 
But, as the known phrase says: "with great power comes great responsibility". there are seveveal risks in the developing technology of AI, some of them are:
* the AI has only defined some simple and sometimes also morally ambigious targets like "make me money as much as you can" or "convince as much people as possible people to use my product", and the ways to achieve that is calculated in almost a misterious way that is pretty often very-hard or nearly impossible to understand. the machine can decide/autonoumously learn to achieve the above targets either by empowering the people and encouraging the to do good (which is probably good), but it is very possible in an equal way that it would choose to do it by manipulating people, abuse them, and use lies, deception, fake news, and  spread hatred.
* As far as I know some scientists claims that AI can theoretically develop a self awareness, we don't know what the rules that will lead it? compassion? self defense? hunger for control and power?

the common problem with the following is that the AI sets the set of rules or the set of the sub-rules by itself.
and practically it seems nearly-impossible to teach the system all the ethic rules manually.
furthermore, in many cases we practically can't fully understand the rules, even after they were self-learned by the machine. 

In case the AI can develop awareness to itself (I think that this is currently a half-phylosophic question because as far as I know, science doesn't yet have a concrete, unumbigious answer for this question) , things would get even more complicated. we would have to confront a (pretty powerfull) self-awared entity that not necesserily understands and obeys the same ethical rules we have and (mostly...) obey.

# The purposed research for a possible solution
Whether you believe in god, awared universe, whatever, or you are a complete atheist, you will probably agree that the human nature tends to pray.
My assumption is that this is for a good reason. I claim that as humans praying to an infinite almighty power may lift  the prayer's awareness from selfish, and self-survival focus to a higher level of awareness so that the awareness can see the "bigger picture".

In similar way, I claim that it may be that if we add to the learning algorithm regular daily routine a session of praying,  it might rewire it's neural connection to be more aware to the bigger picture
